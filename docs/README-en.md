### Configuration
Most configurations are in `setting.py`, others are in backend configurations.

I set many `setting` configuration with my environment variables (such as: `SECRET_KEY`, `OAUTH`, `mysql` and some email configuration parts.) and they did NOT been submitted to the `GitHub`. You can change these in the code with your own configuration or just add them into your environment variables.

Files in `test` directory are for `travis` with automatic testing. You do not need to care about this. Or just use it, in this way to integrate `travis` for automatic testing.

In `bin` directory, we have scripts to deploy with `Nginx`+`Gunicorn`+`virtualenv`+`supervisor` on `linux` and `Nginx` configuration file. You can reference with my article
